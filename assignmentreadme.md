# Description of the project
This project is a step sequencer that allows a user to create simple tunes. There is a futuristic aesthetic. 
It is made in Godot and uses AudioStreams and signals. 

# Instructions for use
To run the project, you can use the .exe file in the /exports folder. Alternatively, you can open the scenes in Godot itelf.

# How it works
The project uses a 2D array of booleans to store what nodes have been turned on. 
The instrument played is based on what row the node is on. There is a small cube at the bottom which displays what column is currently playing.

# What I am most proud of in the assignment
The best part of the assignment was the camera rotation. It looks very cool and I like how it helps everything come together. 
This combined with the statue and skybox helps bring about a cool synthwave aesthetic. The nodes are 3D spheres which rotate with the camera. 

# What I learned
I learned how to rotate objects around a point in Godot. This is a great technique that makes a project look great. 
I also learned how to generate 3D models with generative AI. The model was very vertex and face intensive, 
so it had to be decimated several times before being put into the project. Furthermore, there is a texture on the statue, 
but it is not very effective. Nevertheless, it was great to learn how textures work in game engines.
